# .zip TLD Blocker
FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES ONLY! This was an attempt at blocking Google's new .zip TLD.
If you still would like to try it, you must run as administrater. If you're uncomfortable with that, you can check the source code by renaming the extensions to .txt!
By the way, all issues will NOT BE RESPONDED TO!
